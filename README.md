# Molokai Nut Company (MNC)

The Molokai Nut Company (MNC) manufactures four different products based on macadamia nuts grown on the Hawaiian Islands: chocolate-covered whole nuts (Whole), chocolate-covered nut pieces (Cluster), crunchy nut bars coated with chocolate (Crunch), and plain roasted nuts (Roasted). The company has seen growing demand for these products. However, rising raw material prices and foreign competition are forcing MNC to pay close attention to its margins to ensure it operates as efficiently as possible.

To meet next week's demand, MNC needs to produce at least 1000 kilograms of the Whole product, between 400 and 500 kilograms of the Cluster product, no more than 150 kilograms of the Crunch product, and no more than 200 kilograms of the Roasted product.

Each kilogram of Whole, Cluster, Crunch, and Roasted contains, respectively, 60%, 40%, 20%, and 100% macadamia nuts, with the remaining weight composed of chocolate. The company has 1100 kilograms of nuts and 800 kilograms of chocolate available for use next week.

The various products are also manufactured using four different machines that shell, roast, and coat the nuts with chocolate (if necessary) and package the products. Table 1 summarizes the time required for each product on each machine. Each machine has 60 hours of available time next week.
